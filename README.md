# 5PB-Migration
Migrating 5 PM from multiple legacy sources
Import necessary libraries for Spark SQL, functions, and data types
Import additional libraries for JSON handling, file system interactions, and date/time manipulation
Initialize a Spark session with optimized configurations for large datasets
This Spark session will be used as the entry point for all Spark functionality
Set the log level for the Spark session to reduce verbosity
This will suppress most log messages, only displaying warnings and errors

Factors Influencing Data Migration Time:

Network Bandwidth: This is often the biggest bottleneck. The speed at which data can be transferred over the network (or direct connection) is crucial.
Local Network: Speeds can range from 1 Gbps (gigabit per second) to 100 Gbps or higher.
Internet (WAN): Speeds vary widely depending on your connection, provider, and location. You might get anywhere from a few Mbps (megabits per second) to 1 Gbps or more.
Direct Connection: Dedicated lines can offer very high bandwidth.
Storage I/O Performance: The speed at which data can be read from the source storage and written to the destination storage.
Disk Type: SSDs are much faster than HDDs.
RAID Configuration: Impacts read/write performance.
Storage System Bottlenecks: The source and destination storage systems themselves might have limitations.
Data Transfer Method:
Online/Live Migration: Data is moved while systems are running. This can be slower due to resource contention and the need to keep systems synchronized.
Offline Migration: Systems are taken offline, allowing for faster data transfer.
Data Transfer Tools: Some tools are more efficient than others.
Data Characteristics:
File Size: Many small files can take longer to transfer than a few large files due to overhead.
Data Format: Compressed data might transfer faster, but require extra processing.
Data integrity checks: This needs time to be verified
Distance: If the data needs to travel a large geographical distance it takes longer.
Data pre-processing: This may involve cleanup, normalization and encryption.
Validation: After transfer, validation will take place.
General Estimation Process:

Convert to a Common Unit:

1 Petabyte (PB) = 1000 Terabytes (TB)
1 TB = 1000 Gigabytes (GB)
1 GB = 8 Gigabits (Gb)
Therefore, 5 PB = 5,000 TB = 5,000,000 GB = 40,000,000 Gb (gigabits)
Calculate Transfer Time Based on Bandwidth:

Example 1: 1 Gbps Network
Time = Total Data Size / Bandwidth
Time = 40,000,000 Gb / 1 Gbps = 40,000,000 seconds
40,000,000 seconds = 666,666.67 minutes = 11,111.11 hours = ~463 days
Example 2: 10 Gbps Network
Time = 40,000,000 Gb / 10 Gbps = 4,000,000 seconds
4,000,000 seconds = 66,666.67 minutes = 1,111.11 hours = ~46 days
Example 3: 100 Gbps Network
Time = 40,000,000 Gb / 100 Gbps = 400,000 seconds
400,000 seconds = 6,666.67 minutes = 111.11 hours = ~4.6 days
